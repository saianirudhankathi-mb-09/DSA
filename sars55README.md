Problem Statement:

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

CODE:

class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int x=0;
        for(int ele:nums) x^=ele;
        return x;
    }
}
